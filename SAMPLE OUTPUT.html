     <p> <CENTER> <FONT COLOR= "black" FONT FACE= "CENTURY GOTHIC SIZE= "4"> I am an elementary teacher, but I taught at a secondary level for two years. <br>
I observed that there's a comparison in teaching between the two levels because <br>
you will adjust your method on how to dealing with their differences. Even though <br>
it’s a challenging part for me, I managed it with the proper strategies and <br>
techniques in teaching them. And I also volunteered teacher in my Alma mater for <br> 
one year and I taught in kinder and learners with special needs. It’s a tough but <br>
enjoyable experiences because we see in their faces their eagerness to learn and <br>
positive attitudes in doing their task. They open not only my mind but also my heart <br>
their importance in this world. And that’s the reason why I love my profession <br>
because of them. <br> <br> <br>

    As a teacher, we compare ourselves to a “Faucet” and our learners to a “Pail”. <br>
It is because we input knowledge to them in academic, non-academic, and most <br>
especially about good morals. That can lead them to become a successful person <br>
in the future. </p> </CENTER> </FONT>
